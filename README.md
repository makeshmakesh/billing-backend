POST `/api/create-payment-intent/` Create stripe payment for the invoice  
POST `/api/payment-success/` Mark the invoice paid  


## Stripe Integration
Stripe payment integration is implemented using Stripe.js for card handling and Django backend for creating payment intents and confirming payments.

### Stripe Payment Flow

1. User enters the `invoice_id` and card details on the payment page (`/templates/payment.html`). Visit - `/api/pay/`
2. A POST request is sent to:
   - `/api/create-payment-intent/` â€“ to create a Stripe PaymentIntent using the invoice amount.
3. Stripe processes the card, and on success:
   - A POST request is sent to `/api/payment-success/` with the `invoice_id`.
   - The invoice status is updated to `paid`.

Make sure to set your `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` and `STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` in environment variables before starting the server.
We can store these key in aws ssm as well for better security and maintainability.

#### Test data for stripe

card number success - 4242 4242 4242 4242
